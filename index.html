<p class="we">Hi, my name is Jane Doe and my sister's name is Jen Doe. We began our business back in the Summer of 1997. We started out at both of our home 
   kitchens in Columbus, Mississippi. We are both very outgoing and we love what we do. We are eager for our customers to be happy and satisfied. We know, 
   "word of mouth," as my sister says, can make you or break you. Fortunately for us, it has helped us to get where we are today.</p>
<p class="we">We started out just catering for our friends and family's weddings and special occasion get togethers. It was less than a year we had to hire 
   seven employees to help us keep up with things. fourteen months after we opened the business, we rented our first business space in town.</p>
<p class="we">We have since moved from our first rented location and have went on to build our own facility. We now cater for weddings, university and 
   corporate events etc... If it can be catered, we can do it. We offer the best prices in the county and we always deliver on time.</p>
<p class="we">Catering Services of Columbus offers an extremely wide variety to pick from. We also offer event design, and venues ranging from historical to
   elegant settings. Rather you're looking for a place to hold a corporate dinner or a wedding reception,<strong>we've got you covered. LOOK NO FURTHER!</strong></p>
